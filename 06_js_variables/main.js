/*a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant.
Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared.
If you’re trying to decide between which keyword to use, let or const, 
think about whether you’ll need to reassign the variable later on. 
If you do need to reassign the variable use let, otherwise, use const. */
