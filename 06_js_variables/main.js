/*Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. 
The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1.
Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=), 
the variableâ€™s value is updated and assigned as the new value of that variable.*/
